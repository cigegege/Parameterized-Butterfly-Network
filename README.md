This is a method for generating a parameterized butterfly topology structure of on-chip interconnection networks using MATLAB. In circuit implementation, the butterfly network topology offers certain timing advantages compared to fully connected networks. It enables visualization of parameterized structures of butterfly networks for any power of 2 inputs, such as 8x8, 16x16, and 32x32 input-output configurations.
